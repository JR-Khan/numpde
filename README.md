# Numerical methods for PDE

Codes for my numerical methods for PDE course, taught at TIFR-CAM.

There are some examples of boundary value problems in my [Numerical Analysis](http://github.com/cpraveen/na) codes, under numerical linear algebra.

## Jupyter notebooks

You can copy and paste the python code into a jupyter notebook, e.g., on [colab](http://colab.research.google.com). Add following lines at the top of each notebook to get better images

```
%matplotlib inline
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg'
```
